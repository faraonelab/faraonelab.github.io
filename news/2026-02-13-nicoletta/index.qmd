Acadia University researcher Dr. Nicoletta Faraone (Chemistry) has received a national Mitacs Award for Outstanding Innovation in recognition of her groundbreaking work developing Canada’s first all-natural, long-lasting fabric spray tick repellent.

Based in Acadia’s Chemistry department, Dr. Faraone’s lab leads a research program focused on understanding how ticks interact with their environment—and how we can protect ourselves from them safely and effectively. The award, presented last night at a ceremony at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, honours Canadian researchers whose discoveries are driving innovation and improving lives across the country.
