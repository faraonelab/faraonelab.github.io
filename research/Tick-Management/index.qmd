**From chemical discovery to real-world protection**

Building on our chemical ecology findings, we develop and validate sustainable strategies for tick management.

Our translational work includes:

-   Plant-derived repellents and natural product chemistry

-   Novel formulation strategies (e.g., nanoemulsions, fabric treatments)

-   Laboratory-to-field validation under realistic exposure conditions

-   Integration with climate-adaptive tick management models

-   One Health approaches linking ecology, public health, and environmental sustainability

We aim to design repellents and control strategies that are:

-   Mechanistically informed

-   Environmentally responsible

-   Effective under real-world conditions

By bridging **basic sensory biology with applied innovation**, we contribute to next-generation vector management solutions.
