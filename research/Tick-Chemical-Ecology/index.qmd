**Understanding how ticks detect hosts — and how we can disrupt that process**

Ticks rely on highly specialized sensory systems to locate hosts. Our lab investigates the chemical and neural mechanisms underlying host detection, with a particular focus on:

-   Olfactory processing in *Ixodes scapularis* and *Dermacentor variabilis*

-   Structure and function of Haller’s organ

-   Electrophysiological responses to host- and plant-derived volatiles

-   GC-MS–guided identification of behaviourally active compounds

-   Behavioural assays (olfactometers, arena tracking, host-seeking models)

By linking **molecular signals to neural activation and behavioural output**, we identify sensory “choke points” that can be targeted for repellent development.

This research positions the lab at the forefront of **tick sensory biology**, an emerging field with significant implications for vector control.
