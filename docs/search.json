Our lab investigates the chemical and neural mechanisms underlying host detection, with a particular focus on:\nBy linking molecular signals to neural activation and behavioural output, we identify sensory “choke points” that can be targeted for repellent development.\nThis research positions the lab at the forefront of tick sensory biology, an emerging field with significant implications for vector control."

    "text": "Acadia University researcher Dr. Nicoletta Faraone (Chemistry) has received a national Mitacs Award for Outstanding Innovation in recognition of her groundbreaking work developing Canada’s first all-natural, long-lasting fabric spray tick repellent.\nBased in Acadia’s Chemistry department, Dr. Faraone’s lab leads a research program focused on understanding how ticks interact with their environment—and how we can protect ourselves from them safely and effectively. The award, presented last night at a ceremony at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, honours Canadian researchers whose discoveries are driving innovation and improving lives across the country."

    "text": "A behavioural and neuropharmacological investigation of a natural compound\nNatural compounds derived from fungi have long influenced nervous systems across species. The Faraone Lab is investigating psilocybin as a neuroactive compound using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism.\nWhile psilocybin has demonstrated clinical promise in the treatment of depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD, its mechanistic effects on neural circuitry remain poorly understood. Our research addresses this gap through controlled behavioural and neuropharmacological experimentation.\nOur current research includes:\nUsing Drosophila melanogaster provides a genetically tractable and evolutionarily informative system in which serotonergic signalling pathways are conserved and experimentally accessible.\nBy bridging natural product chemistry with behavioural neuroscience, this research expands the lab’s expertise into neuroecological modulation, generating mechanistic insight into how bioactive fungal compounds alter neural systems."
