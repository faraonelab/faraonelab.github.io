We are an interdisciplinary research group focused on **chemical ecology, natural product chemistry, and vector biology**. Our research investigates how ticks detect hosts and respond to repellents, translating fundamental discoveries into innovative, environmentally responsible solutions for tick management and disease prevention. Close collaboration with students, industry, and community partners ensures that our work delivers both scientific insight and real-world impact.
