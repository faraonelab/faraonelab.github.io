    "text": "Measurement of the two distinct components—scattering and absorption—of a single particle’s optical extinction provides fundamentally important and complementary information on how that object processes light: either scattering it back to the far-field or converting it into internal excitation. Yet measurement and separation of each is an extraordinarily difficult experimental task. Far-field optical spectroscopies and microscopies are also limited by diffraction, which further restricts the amount of information attainable. In spite of these constraints, we combine ideas from photothermal heterodyne imaging and plasmon-enhanced super-resolution imaging to correlate the absorption spectra of individual nanoscopic objects with their precise locations below the diffraction limit. Active far-field manipulation and control of the thermal near-field in engineered metamaterials extends this work in new directions that we are currently exploring in collaboration with multiple experimental teams."

Together with experiment, we leverage these advances to resolve open fundamental questions in nano-spectroscopy, perform entirely new materials characterization techniques at the single-particle level, and discover advanced materials endowed with unprecedented functionalities."

    "text": "Coupling between light and matter is extraordinarily weak. Optical resonator cavities provide an opportunity to coax repeated light-matter interactions, thereby enhancing coupling far beyond that of free space. In such settings, coupling can be so strong that it is no longer possible to disentangle the original optical and material degrees of freedom, resulting in non-equilibrium quantum optical states endowed with properties beyond those of their components. Together with experiment we develop theoretical models and simulation tools necessary to explicitly connect nanophotonic cavity + qubit systems with quantum many-body processes and phenomena. Our work not only enables the simulation of quantum many-body physics in nanophotonic devices but also provides opportunities to protect fragile quantum correlations against decoherence."
